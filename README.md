# Bike-sales-analysis

A machine learning-powered web application to predict the resale price of used bikes based on key features such as mileage, engine power, usage, brand, and location. This project was completed as part of my internship at **Unified Mentors** under the role of a **Data Science Intern**.

## 📌 Internship Context

This project was undertaken during my internship at **Unified Mentors**, where I contributed to building real-world data-driven applications using Python and machine learning. The objective was to apply supervised learning techniques, perform data wrangling and visualization, and deploy the model in a user-accessible format using Streamlit.
